* Installation of HTS-demo_NIT-SONG070-F001
===========================================

1. HTS-demo_NIT-SONG070-F001 requires SPTK-3.9, HTS-2.3, and hts_engine API-1.10.
   Please install them before running this demo.
   You can download them from the following websites:

   SPTK: http://sp-tk.sourceforge.net/
   HTS: http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/
   hts_engine API: http://hts-engine.sourceforge.net/
   WORLD: in the externs/WORLD_v2 (please enter it, make analysis synth, and the executable will be generated in the build folder).

   If you use STRAIGHT, MATLAB and STRAIGHTV40 are required.

   STRAIGHT: https://github.com/HidekiKawahara/legacy_STRAIGHT


2. Setup HTS-demo_NIT-SONG070-F001 by running configure script:

   % cd HTS-demo_NIT-SONG070-F001
   % ./configure --with-sptk-search-path=/usr/local/SPTK-3.9/bin \
                 --with-hts-search-path=/usr/local/HTS-2.3_for_HTK-3.4.1/bin \
                 --with-hts-engine-search-path=/usr/local/hts_engine_API-1.10/bin

   If you use STRAIGHT, configure script can be run as follows.

   % ./configure --with-sptk-search-path=/usr/local/SPTK-3.9/bin \
                 --with-hts-search-path=/usr/local/HTS-2.3_for_HTK-3.4.1/bin \
                 --with-hts-engine-search-path=/usr/local/hts_engine_API-1.10/bin \
                 --with-matlab-search-path=/usr/local/matlab/bin \
                 --with-straight-path=/usr/local/STRAIGHTV40 \
                 USESTRAIGHT=1
				 
   If you use WORLD, configure script can be run as follows.
   % ./configure --with-sptk-search-path=/usr/local/SPTK-3.9/bin \
                 --with-hts-search-path=/usr/local/HTS-2.3_for_HTK-3.4.1/bin \
                 --with-hts-engine-search-path=/usr/local/hts_engine_API-1.10/bin \
				 --with-world-path=$(pwd)/externs/WORLD_v2/build \
				 USEWORLD=1

   You can change various parameters such as speech analysis conditions and model training conditions
   through ./configure arguments.  For example

   % ./configure MGCORDER=34 GAMMA=0 FREQWARP=0.0              (34-th order cepstrum)
   % ./configure MGCORDER=34 GAMMA=0 FREQWARP=0.55             (34-th order Mel-cepstrum)

   % ./configure MGCORDER=12 GAMMA=1 FREQWARP=0.0  LNGAIN=0    (12-th order LSP,     linear gain)
   % ./configure MGCORDER=12 GAMMA=1 FREQWARP=0.0  LNGAIN=1    (12-th order LSP,     log gain)
   % ./configure MGCORDER=12 GAMMA=1 FREQWARP=0.55 LNGAIN=1    (12-th order Mel-LSP, log gain)
   % ./configure MGCORDER=12 GAMMA=3 FREQWARP=0.55 LNGAIN=1    (12-th order MGC-LSP, log gain)

   % ./configure NSTATE=7 NITER=10 WFLOOR=5   (# of HMM states=7, # of EM iterations=10, mix weight floor=5)

   Please refer to the help message for details:

   % ./configure --help


3. Start running demonstration as follows:

   % cd HTS-demo_NIT-SONG070-F001
   % make

   After composing training data, HMMs are estimated and speech waveforms are synthesized.
   It takes about 6 to 12 hours :-)
